Small mod that replaces one biome with another, without affecting other parts of the generation. 
Useful for preventing certain datapack biomes from generating, fixing modded biomes 
not appearing, or polishing up that almost-perfect seed.

## Examples

A case with vanilla biomes. This is what configuration file looks like:
```
minecraft:dark_forest > minecraft:cherry_grove
```
